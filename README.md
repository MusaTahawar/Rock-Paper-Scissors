# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" in Python. It allows you to play against the computer for a specified number of rounds.

## Getting Started

2. **Run the game**:

    ```shell
    python rock_paper_scissors.py
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## How to Play

- You'll be prompted to enter your name.
- For each round, you can choose one of the following options:
  - Type "1" for Rock
  - Type "2" for Paper
  - Type "3" for Scissors

The computer will randomly select an option, and the winner of the round will be determined based on the classic rules of the game. The first player to win two rounds wins the game.
